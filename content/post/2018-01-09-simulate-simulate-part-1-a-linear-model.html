<p>Confession: I love simulations.</p>
<p>In simulations you get to define everything about a model and then see how that model behaves over the long run. It‚Äôs like getting the luxury of taking many samples instead of only the one real one we have resources for in an actual study.</p>
<p>I find simulations incredibly useful in understanding statistical theory and assumptions of linear models. When someone tells me with great certainty ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to meet that assumption because [fill in the blank]‚Äù or asks ‚ÄúDoes it matter that [something complicated]?‚Äù, I often turn to simulations instead of textbooks to check.</p>
<p>I like simulations for the same reasons I like building Bayesian models and using resampling methods (i.e., Monte Carlo) for inference. Building the simulation increases my understanding of the problem and makes all the assumptions clearer to me because I must use them explicitly. Plus it‚Äôs fun to put the code together and explore the results. üôÇ</p>

<h1>Simulate, simulate, dance to the music</h1>
<p>Simulations have been so helpful in my own understanding of statistical models that I find myself wishing I knew how to use them more in teaching and consulting. Being able to build a simulation could really help folks understand the strengths and weaknesses of their analysis. I haven‚Äôt managed to fit it in so far, but it‚Äôs always on my mind. Hence, this post.</p>
<p>Today I‚Äôm going to go over an example of simulating data from a two-group linear model. I‚Äôll work work up to linear mixed models and generalized linear mixed models (the fun stuff! üòÜ) in subsequent posts.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-statistical-model" class="section level1">
<h1>The statistical model</h1>
<p><strong>Warning: Here there be equations.</strong></p>
<p>If you‚Äôre like me and your brain says ‚ÄúI think this section must not pertain to me‚Äù when your eyes hit mathematical notation, you can jump right down to the R code in the next section. But if you can power through, these equations are actually pretty useful when setting up a simulation (honest).</p>
<p>A simulation for a linear model is based on the statistical model. The statistical model is an equation that describes the processes we believe gave rise to the observed response variable. It includes parameters to describe the assumed effect of explanatory variables on the response variable as well as a description of any distributions associated with processes we assume are random variation. (There is more in-depth coverage of the statistical model in Stroup‚Äôs 2013 <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Generalized_Linear_Mixed_Models.html?id=GcGrySpkXRMC">Generalized Linear Mixed Models</a> book if you are interested and have access to it.)</p>
<p>So the statistical model is where we write down the exact assumptions we are making when we fit a linear model to a set of data.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a linear model for two groups. I wrote the statistical model to match the form of the default summary output from a model fit with <code>lm()</code> in R.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1*I_{(group_t=\textit{&#39;&#39;group&#39;&#39;})} + \epsilon_t\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span> is the observed values for the quantitative response variable; <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> goes from 1 to the number of observations in the dataset<br />
</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is the mean response variable when the group is ‚Äúgroup1‚Äù</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is the difference in mean response between the groups, ‚Äúgroup2‚Äù minus ‚Äúgroup1‚Äù.<br />
</li>
<li>The indicator variable, <span class="math inline">\(I_{(group_t=\textit{&#39;&#39;group2&#39;&#39;})}\)</span>, is 1 when the group is ‚Äúgroup2‚Äù and 0 otherwise, as <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> only affects the response variable for observations in ‚Äúgroup2‚Äù</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t\)</span> is the random variation present for each observation that is not explained by the group variable. These are assumed to come from an iid normal distribution with a mean of 0 and some shared variance, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="a-single-simulation-from-a-two-group-model" class="section level1">
<h1>A single simulation from a two-group model</h1>
<p>I use the statistical model to build a simulation. In this case I‚Äôll call my response variable ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù, and the two groups ‚Äúgroup1‚Äù and ‚Äúgroup2‚Äù. I‚Äôll have 10 observations per group (it‚Äôs possible to simulate unbalanced groups but balanced groups is a good place to start).</p>
<p>I‚Äôll set my seed so these particular results can be reproduced.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(16)</code></pre>
<p>I start out by defining what the ‚Äútruth‚Äù is in the simulation by setting all the parameters in the statistical model to a value of my choosing. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do today.</p>
<ul>
<li>The true group mean (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>) for ‚Äúgroup1‚Äù will be 5</li>
<li>The mean of ‚Äúgroup2‚Äù will be 2 less than ‚Äúgroup1‚Äù (<span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>)</li>
<li>The shared variance will be set at 4 (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span>), so the standard deviation (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>) is 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>I‚Äôll define the number of groups and number of replicates per group while I‚Äôm at it. The total number of observations is the number of groups times the number of replicates per group, which is <code>2*10 = 20</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ngroup = 2
nrep = 10
b0 = 5
b1 = -2
sd = 2</code></pre>
<p>I need to create the variable I‚Äôll call ‚Äúgroup‚Äù to use as the explanatory variable when fitting a model in R. I use <code>rep()</code> a lot when doing simulations in order to repeat values of variables to appropriately match the scenario I‚Äôm working in. Here I‚Äôll repeat each level of <code>group</code> 10 times (<code>nrep</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>( group = rep( c(&quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group2&quot;), each = nrep) )</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot;
##  [8] &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group1&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot;
## [15] &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot; &quot;group2&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Next I‚Äôll simulate the random errors. Remember I defined these above as <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_t \thicksim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span>. To simulate these I‚Äôll take random draws from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 2 (note that <code>rnorm()</code> in takes the standard deviation as input, not the variance). Every observation has a random error, so I need to make 20 draws total (<code>ngroup*nrep</code>).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>( eps = rnorm(ngroup*nrep, 0, sd) )</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  0.9528268 -0.2507600  2.1924324 -2.8884581  2.2956586 -0.9368241

<p>Now I have the fixed estimates of parameters, the variable <code>group</code> on which to base the indicator variable, and the simulated errors drawn from the defined distribution. That‚Äôs all the pieces I need to calculate my response variable.</p>
<p>The statistical model</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1*I_{(group_t=\textit{&#39;&#39;group&#39;&#39;})} + \epsilon_t\]</span></p>
<p>is my guide for how to combine these pieces to create the simulated response variable, <span class="math inline">\(y_t\)</span>. Notice I create the indicator variable in R with <code>group == &quot;group2&quot;</code> and call the simulated response variable <code>growth</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>( growth = b0 + b1*(group == &quot;group2&quot;) + eps )</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1]  5.952827  4.749240  7.192432  2.111542  7.295659  4.063176  2.988099

<p>It‚Äôs not necessary for this simple case, but I often store the variables I will use in fitting the model in a dataset to help keep things organized. This becomes more important when working with more variables. I‚Äôll skip this step today.</p>
<p>Once the response and explanatory variables have been created, it‚Äôs time for model fitting. I can fit the two group linear model with <code>lm()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>growthfit = lm(growth ~ group)
summary(growthfit)</code></pre>

<h1>Make a function for the simulation</h1>
<p>A single simulation can help us understand the statistical model, but it doesn‚Äôt help us see how the model behaves over the long run. To repeat this simulation many times in R we‚Äôll want to ‚Äúfunctionize‚Äù the data simulating and model fitting process.</p>
<p>In my function I‚Äôm going to set all the arguments to the parameter values I‚Äôve defined above. I allow some flexibility, though, so the argument values can be changed if I want to explore the simulation with different coefficient values, a different number of replications, or a different amount of random variation.</p>
<p>This function returns a linear model fit with <code>lm</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>twogroup_fun = function(nrep = 10, b0 = 5, b1 = -2, sigma = 2) {
     ngroup = 2

     eps = rnorm(ngroup*nrep, 0, sd)
     growth = b0 + b1*(group == &quot;group2&quot;) + eps
     growthfit = lm(growth ~ group)
     growthfit

<p>I test the function, using the same seed, to make things are working as expected and that I get the same results as above.</p>

<h1>Repeat the simulation many times</h1>
<p>Now that I have a working function to simulate data and fit the model, it‚Äôs time to do the simulation many times. The model from each individual simulation is saved to allow exploration of long run model performance.</p>
<p>This is a task I‚Äôve commonly used <code>replicate()</code> for. The <code>rerun()</code> function from package <strong>purrr</strong> is equivalent to <code>replicate()</code> with <code>simplify = FALSE</code>, and I‚Äôll use it here for convenience.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr)</code></pre>

<h1>Extracting results from the linear model</h1>
<p>There are many elements of our model that we might be interested in exploring, including estimated coefficients, estimated standard deviations/variances, and the statistical results (test statistics/p-values).</p>
<p>To get the coefficients and statistical tests of coefficients we can use <code>tidy()</code> from package <strong>broom</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(broom)</code></pre>
<p>This returns the information on coefficients and tests of those coefficients in a tidy format that is easy to work with.</p>

<p>I have often been interested in understanding how the variances/standard deviations behave over the long run, in particular in mixed models. For a linear model we can extract an estimate of the residual standard deviation from the <code>summary()</code> output. This can be squared to get the variance as needed.</p>

</div>
<div id="simulation-results" class="section level1">
<h1>Simulation results</h1>
<p>Now for the fun part! Given we know the truth, how do the parameters behave over many samples?</p>
<p>To extract any results of interest I loop through the list of models, which I‚Äôve stored in <code>sims</code>, and pull out the element of interest. Functions from package <strong>purrr</strong> are useful here for looping through the list of models. I‚Äôll use functions from <strong>dplyr</strong> for any data manipulation and plot distributions via <strong>ggplot2</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>suppressMessages( library(dplyr) )
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p><strong>Estimated differences in mean response</strong></p>
<p>As this is a linear model about differences among groups, the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> is one of the statistics of primary interest. What does the distribution of differences in mean growth between groups look like? Here‚Äôs a density plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sims %&gt;%
     map_df(tidy) %&gt;%
     filter(term == &quot;groupgroup2&quot;) %&gt;%
     ggplot( aes(estimate) ) +
          geom_density(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, alpha = .5) +
          geom_vline( xintercept = -2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-09-simulate-simulate-part-1-a-linear-model_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It‚Äôs a simulation result like this one, from a scenario involving relatively few samples of a noisy measurement that I think can be so compelling. Sure, ‚Äúon average‚Äù we get the correct result, as the peak is right around the true value of <code>-2</code>. However, there is quite a range in the estimated coefficient across simulations, with some samples leading to overestimation and some to underestimation of the parameter. Some models even get the sign of the coefficient wrong. See Gelman and Carlin‚Äôs 2014 paper, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/retropower_final.pdf">Beyond Power Calculations: Assessing Type S (Sign) and Type M (Magnitude) Errors</a> if you are interested in further discussion.</p>
<p><strong>Estimates of the standard deviation</strong></p>
<p>I can do a similar plot exploration of the residual standard deviation, extracting <code>sigma</code> from the model object and plotting it as a density plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sims %&gt;%
     map_dbl(~summary(.x)$sigma) %&gt;%
     data.frame(sigma = .) %&gt;%
     ggplot( aes(sigma) ) +
          geom_density(fill = &quot;blue&quot;, alpha = .5) +
          geom_vline(xintercept = 2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-09-simulate-simulate-part-1-a-linear-model_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The estimated variation ranges between 1 to just over 3, and the distribution is roughly centered on the true value of 2. Like with the coefficient above, the model performs pretty well on average but any single model can have a biased estimate of the standard deviation.</p>
<p>The standard deviation is underestimated a bit more than 50% of the time.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sims %&gt;%
     map_dbl(~summary(.x)$sigma) %&gt;%
     {. &lt; 2} %&gt;%
     mean()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.539</code></pre>
<p><strong>Statistical results</strong></p>
<p>If the goal of a simulation is to get an idea of the statistical power of a test we could look at the proportion of times the null hypothesis was rejected given a fixed alpha level (often 0.05, but of course it can be something else).</p>
<p>Here the proportion of models that correctly rejected the null hypothesis, given that we know it‚Äôs not true, is just over 56%. That‚Äôs an estimate of statistical power.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>sims %&gt;%
     map_df(tidy) %&gt;%
     filter(term == &quot;groupgroup2&quot;) %&gt;%
     pull(p.value) %&gt;%
     {. &lt;  0.05} %&gt;%
     mean()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.563</code></pre>
<p>Those are the basics that I generally pull out of models, but any output from the model is fair game. For linear models you could pull out <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> or the overall F-test, etc.</p>
