description: "Since January is the month for analyzing last year's data, I take a quick look at my 2017 gas mileage in my commuter car (Fiesta! `r emo::ji('fireworks')`).  I use package googlesheets for reading data, skimr for a quick summary of the dataset, and ggplot2 for plotting."

```{r setup, echo = FALSE}
skimr::skim_with(numeric = list(hist = NULL))
```

It's January - time to see how we did on car gas mileage last year!

We purchased a used 2011 Ford Fiesta in 2016.  It replaced a 1991 Honda CRX, which was running like a champ but was starting to look a little, well, limited in its safety features. `r emo::ji("tongue")`

I drive ~70 commuting miles each day, and we wanted a car we could afford that was competitive with the CRX on gas mileage.  The CRX averaged solidly just over 40 mpg.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The dog wonders if the gas mileage will be good enough"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/fiesta.jpg")
```

# The gas mileage data

We record gas mileage for all our vehicles on Google Sheets, so I can read the data in directly from there.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(googlesheets) # v 0.2.2
library(skimr) # v. 1.0.1
library(dplyr) # v. 0.7.4
```

The workbook has a sheet for every year of ownership (into the future! `r emo::ji("laugh")`) plus service records.

```{r}
gs_title("Fiesta mpg")
```

```{r}
fiesta2017 = gs_title("Fiesta mpg") %>%
     gs_read("2017")
```

We calculate gas mileage (`mpgcalc`) based on recorded gallons and mileage driven every time we get gas.  We also record what the car estimated the gas mileage would be (`mpggage`).  

```{r}
head(fiesta2017)
```

Here's my first chance to use functions from package **skimr** to get a quick summary of the variables in the dataset. (I've removed the spark histograms since I haven't gotten them to play nicely in HTML.)

```{r}
skim(fiesta2017)
```

I'll need to convert `date` to a date and remove that missing value from `mileage` before proceeding (looks like we forget to enter the mileage on one gas stop).

```{r}
fiesta2017 = fiesta2017 %>%
     mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y") ) %>%
     filter( !is.na(mileage) )
```

The `skim` output shows an odd `mpgcalc` value as the max, with a mpg over 90.  

```{r}
filter(fiesta2017, mpgcalc > 50)
```

Turns out something weird happened on June 5th.  There are two data points, one that looks pretty standard and the other that is impossibly high for `mpgcalc`.  

```{r}
filter(fiesta2017, date == as.Date("2017-06-05") )
```

I'll have to remove the odd data point as I'm not sure what the mistake is (changing the mileage to `3` instead of `6` seems a reasonable guess but that still led to something impossibly large).

```{r}
fiesta2017 = filter(fiesta2017, mpgcalc <= 50)
```

# Plot gas mileage through time

I'll use **ggplot2** for plotting.

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # v. 2.2.1
```

**Observed gas mileage over the year**

Here's a plot of calculated gas mileage over the year, plotted via **ggplot2**.  I put a horizontal line at 40 mpg and one at the annual average observed mpg to get an idea of how we're meeting the "40 mpg" goal.

```{r,dpi = 300}
ggplot(fiesta2017, aes(date, mpgcalc) ) +
     geom_line() +
     theme_bw() +
     geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 40, color = "40 mpg") ) +
     geom_hline(aes(yintercept = mean(fiesta2017$mpgcalc), colour = "Average observed mpg") ) +
     labs(y = "Miles per gallon", x = NULL) +
     scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
                  date_labels = "%b",
                  limits = c( as.Date("2017-01-01"), as.Date("2017-12-31") ),
                  expand = c(0, 0) ) +
     scale_color_manual(name = NULL, values = c("black", "#009E73") ) +
     theme(legend.position = "bottom",
           legend.direction = "horizontal")
```

That high point is a high value for both the observed and estimated mpg, so I'm guessing the driving conditions were good for that tank. `r emo::ji("smile")`

```{r}
filter(fiesta2017, mpgcalc > 45)
```

**Compare observed mpg vs car-estimated mpg**

It's fun to watch how the estimated mpg is affected by conditions while I'm driving (e.g., AC, defrost, wind), but it looks like whatever that algorithm is tends to overestimate the gas mileage.  But not always!

```{r, dpi = 300}
ggplot(fiesta2017, aes(date, mpgcalc) ) +
     geom_line( aes(color = "Calculated mpg") ) +
     geom_line( aes(y = mpggage, color = "Estimated mpg") ) +
     theme_bw() +
     labs(y = "Miles per gallon", x = NULL) +
     scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month",
                  date_labels = "%b",
                  limits = c( as.Date("2017-01-01"), as.Date("2017-12-31") ),
                  expand = c(0, 0) ) +
     scale_color_manual(name = NULL, values = c("black", "#009E73") ) +
     theme(legend.position = "bottom",
           legend.direction = "horizontal")
```
