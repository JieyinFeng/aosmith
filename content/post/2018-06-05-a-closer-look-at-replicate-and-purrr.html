<p>I’ve done a couple of posts so far on simulations, <a href="https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/01/09/simulate-simulate-part1/">here</a> and <a href="https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/04/23/simulate-simulate-part-2/">here</a>, where I demonstrate how to build a function for simulating data from a defined linear model and then explore long-run behavior of models fit to the simulated datasets. The focus of those posts was on the general simulation process, and I didn’t go into much detail on the specific R code. In this post I’ll focus in on the code I use for repeatedly simulating data and extracting output, specifically talking about the function <code>replicate()</code> and the <em>map</em> family of functions from package <strong>purrr</strong>.</p>
<div id="the-replicate-function" class="section level1">
<h1>The replicate() function</h1>
<p>The <code>replicate()</code> function is a member of the <em>apply</em> family of functions in base R.<br />
Specifically, from the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>replicate</code> is a wrapper for the common use of <code>sapply</code> for repeated evaluation of an expression (which will usually involve random number generation).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the documentation mentions <em>repeated evaluations</em> and that the use of <code>replicate()</code> involves <em>random number generation</em>. Those are primary parts of the simulations I do. While I don’t actually know the <em>apply</em> family of functions very well, I use <code>replicate()</code> a lot (although also see <code>purrr::rerun()</code>). Using <code>replicate()</code> is an alternative to building a <code>for()</code> loop to repeatedly simulate new values.</p>
<p>The <code>replicate()</code> function takes three arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>n</code>, which is the number of replications to perform. This is where I set the number of simulations I want to run.<br />
</li>
<li><code>expr</code>, the expression that should be run repeatedly. I’ve only ever used a function here.<br />
</li>
<li><code>simplify</code>, which controls the type of output the results of <code>expr</code> are saved into. Use <code>simplify = FALSE</code> to get vectors saved into a list instead of in an array.</li>
</ul>
<div id="simple-example-of-replicate" class="section level2">
<h2>Simple example of replicate()</h2>
<p>Let’s say I wanted to simulate some values from a normal distribution, which I can do using the <code>rnorm()</code> function. Below I’ll simulate five values from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 (which are the defaults for <code>mean</code> and <code>sd</code> arguments, respectively).</p>
<p>Since I’m going generate random numbers I’ll set the seed so anyone following along at home will see the same values.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(16)
rnorm(5, mean = 0, sd = 1)</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1]  0.4764134 -0.1253800  1.0962162 -1.4442290  1.1478293</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>rnorm()</code> directly gives me a single set of simulated values. How do I simulate 5 values from this same distribution multiple times? This is where <code>replicate()</code> comes in. It allows me to run the function I put in <code>expr</code> exactly <code>n</code> times.</p>
<p>Here I’ll ask for three runs of 5 values each. Notice I use <code>simplify = FALSE</code> to get a list as output.</p>
<p>The output below is a list of three vectors. Each vector is from a unique run of the function, so contains five random numbers drawn from the normal distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(16)
replicate(n = 3, rnorm(5, 0, 1), simplify = FALSE )</code></pre>
<pre><code># [[1]]
# [1]  0.4764134 -0.1253800  1.0962162 -1.4442290  1.1478293

<p>Note if I don’t use <code>simplify = FALSE</code> I will get a matrix of values instead of a list. Each column in the matrix is the output from one run of the function. In this case there will be three columns in the output, one for each run, and 5 rows. This can be a useful output type for simulations. I focus on list output throughout the rest of this post only because that’s what I have been using recently for simulations.</p>

<div id="an-equivalent-for-loop-example" class="section level2">
<h2>An equivalent for() loop example</h2>
<p>A <code>for()</code> loop can be used in place of <code>replicate()</code> for simulations. With time and practice I’ve found <code>replicate()</code> to be much more convenient in terms of writing the code. However, in my experience some folks find <code>for()</code> loops intuitive when they are starting out in R. I think it’s because <code>for()</code> loops are more explicit on the looping process: the user can see that <code>i</code> is looped over and the output for each <code>i</code> iteration is saved into the output object because the code is written out explicitly.</p>
<p>In my example I’ll save the output of each iteration of the loop into a list called <code>list1</code>. I initialize this as an empty list prior to starting the loop. To match what I did with <code>replicate()</code> I do three iterations of the loop (<code>i in 1:3</code>), drawing 5 values via <code>rnorm()</code> each time.</p>
<p>The result is identical to my <code>replicate()</code> code above. It took a little more code to do it but the process is very clear since it is explicitly written out.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(16)
list1 = list() # Make an empty list to save output in
for (i in 1:3) { # Indicate number of iterations with &quot;i&quot;
    list1[[i]] = rnorm(5, 0, 1) # Save output in list for each iteration
}

<div id="using-replicate-on-a-user-made-function" class="section level2">
<h2>Using replicate() on a user-made function</h2>
<p>When I do simulations to explore the behavior of linear models under different scenarios I will create a function to simulate the data and fit the model. For example, here’s a function I used in an <a href="https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/01/09/simulate-simulate-part1/">earlier blog post</a> to simulate data from and then fit a two group linear model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>twogroup_fun = function(nrep = 10, b0 = 5, b1 = -2, sigma = 2) {
     ngroup = 2
     group = rep( c(&quot;group1&quot;, &quot;group2&quot;), each = nrep)
     eps = rnorm(ngroup*nrep, 0, sigma)
     growth = b0 + b1*(group == &quot;group2&quot;) + eps
     growthfit = lm(growth ~ group)
     growthfit
}</code></pre>
<p>The output is a model fit to data generated from the fixed and random (residual) effects.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>twogroup_fun()</code></pre>
<pre><code># 
# Call:
# lm(formula = growth ~ group)
# 
# Coefficients:
# (Intercept)  groupgroup2  
#       4.686       -1.267</code></pre>
<p>To explore the long-run behavior in my simulated scenario I will repeat the data generation and model fitting many times using <code>replicate()</code>. The result is a list of fitted models. I’ll run the function 5 times and save the result as <code>sim_lm</code> to use throughout the next section on <code>map()</code>.</p>

length(sim_lm)</code></pre>

<div id="using-purrrmap-for-looping-through-lists" class="section level1">
<h1>Using purrr::map() for looping through lists</h1>
<p>So I have a list of fitted models from <code>replicate()</code>; now what?</p>
<p>The <code>replicate()</code> function was about repeatedly running a function. Once I have the repeated runs I can explore the long-run behavior of some statistic by extracting value(s) from the resulting models. This involves looping through the list of models.</p>
<p>Looping through the list can be done using a <code>for()</code> loop, but I prefer to use functions that do the looping without all the typing. In particular, these days I use the <em>map</em> family of functions from the <strong>purrr</strong> package to loop through lists. Before <strong>purrr</strong> I primarily used <code>lapply()</code> (the only other <em>apply</em> family function that I know 😆).</p>
<p>The <code>map()</code> function takes a list as input and puts the output into a list of the same length. The first argument to <code>map()</code> is the list to loop through and the second argument is the function to apply to each element of the list.</p>
<p>For example, I can pull out the coefficients of each model in my 5-run simulation by looping through <code>sim_lm</code> and applying the <code>coef()</code> function to each list element.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(purrr) # v. 0.2.5

<div id="other-variants-of-map-for-non-list-outputs" class="section level2">
<h2>Other variants of map() for non-list outputs</h2>
<p>There are many variants of <code>map()</code> that are convenient for saving results into something other than a list. For example, if I am going to extract a single numeric value from each model, such as <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span>, I might want the output to be a numeric vector instead of a list. I can use <code>map_dbl()</code> for this.</p>
<p>The unadjusted <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> from a model fit with <code>lm()</code> can be pulled from the model <code>summary()</code> output. The code looks like: <code>summary(model)$r.squared</code>,<br />
where “model” is a fitted model.</p>
<p>So getting <span class="math inline">\(R^2\)</span> involves extracting a value after applying a function, which isn’t quite as straightforward as applying a single function to every model in the list like I did with <code>coef()</code>. This gives me a chance to demonstrate the formula coding styling available in <em>map</em> functions. In formula coding a tilde (<code>~</code>) goes in front of the function and <code>.x</code> refers to the list element.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_dbl(sim_lm, ~summary(.x)$r.squared)</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] 0.22823549 0.16199867 0.25730022 0.38591045 0.06375695</code></pre>
<p>If you don’t like the formula style you can use an anonymous function inside <em>map</em> functions, where the function argument is used to refer to the list element.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>map_dbl(sim_lm, function(x) summary(x)$r.squared)</code></pre>
<pre><code># [1] 0.22823549 0.16199867 0.25730022 0.38591045 0.06375695</code></pre>
<p>For data.frame output we can use <code>map_dfr()</code> for row binding or <em>stacking</em> results together into a single data.frame.</p>
<p>Estimated coefficients, their standard errors, and their statistical tests from models fit with <code>lm()</code> can be extracted into a tidy data.frame using <code>broom::tidy()</code>. Looping through the results and doing this for each model via <code>map_dfr()</code> will put the output in one data.frame instead of storing the individual data.frames for each model as one element of a list.</p>

<p>The <code>map_dfr()</code> function has an additional argument, <code>.id</code>, which can be used to store the list names (if the original list had names) or add the list index to the output (if it didn’t have names).

<p>The <em>map</em> family of functions can easily be used with pipes as one step in a chain of functions. I can, for example, take the estimates I get using <code>broom::tidy</code>, pull out the estimated intercepts, and then plot a histogram of those estimates. I’ll need packages <strong>dplyr</strong> and <strong>ggplot2</strong> for this.</p>

<p>You can see all the steps in the pipe chain below. I loop through <code>sim_lm</code> using <code>map_dfr()</code> to extract the coefficients from each element of the list and output a data.frame of results. I use <code>dplyr::filter()</code> to keep only the rows with estimated intercepts and then plot a histogram of these estimates for the whole simulation with <code>ggplot2::qplot()</code>.</p>
