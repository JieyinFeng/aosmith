<p>I currently work as a consulting statistician. This involves a lot of advising researchers on statistics, statistical programming, study design, etc., with only a smidge of time dedicated to doing novel analyses.</p>
<p>I work primarily in R, and teach R workshops at the graduate-student level to make moving into a programming language easier for students.</p>
